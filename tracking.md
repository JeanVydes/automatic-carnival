# Methodology

This document tracks the development progress of the project, including branch management and pull requests (PRs) for each feature or bug fix.

- `main` branch is for stable code.
- `dev` branch is for development.
- Create feature branches from `dev` for new features or bug fixes, example a branch for `service` layer, or `repository` layer.
- Merge feature branches into `dev` after review and testing.
- Periodically merge `dev` into `main` for stable releases.
